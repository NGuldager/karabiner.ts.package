title: Duo Modifiers
---

Duo-modifier is an idea combined with [home row mods](https://precondition.github.io/home-row-mods)
and [duo-layer](/rules/duo-layer):

- Map one single key to mod(s) will be similar to either [layer](/rules/layer)
  or [simlayer](/rules/simlayer), which would have the same problems.
- Duo-modifier uses 2 keys instead, similar to [duo-layer](/rules/duo-layer).
- It also has [the same problems as duo-layer](/rules/duo-layer#problems-in-duo-layer).

Adjust `basic.simultaneous_threshold_milliseconds` to your typing speed and habit.

:::tip
When get started, it can be very useful to show a notification when the
mod(s) are activated, see [an example here](https://github.com/evan-liu/karabiner-config/blob/fab052dc5e738c91adfae46aabeb17b38f4959fe/utils.ts#L85).
